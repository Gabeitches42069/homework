<h1>Vossi Bop</h1>
<h2>Stormzy</h2>
<p><em> My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
<br> I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
   <br> Gettin' freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
   <br> Then I finish with a facial just to top it off (ayy)
   <br> My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
   <br> I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
   <br> Gettin' freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
   <br> Then I finish with a facial just to top it off (ayy) </em><br>
    
   <br> You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
   <br> I had a couple seeds, I made a forest
   <br> I put in the work and take the profit
   <br> Lookin' at my girl like "What a goddess" (thank God)
   <br> Rule number two, don't make the promise
   <br> If you can't keep the deal then just be honest (just be honest)
   <br> I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris (Chuck Norris)
   <br> Fuck the government and fuck Boris (yeah)
   <br> I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
   <br> Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
   <br>I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
   <br> I got the sauce (sauce), don't know what you thought (thoughts)
   <br> Catch me up in the snow in my sliders and my shorts (shorts)
   <br> Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
   <br> I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk
   <br> I don't fuck with her
   <br> Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her
   <br> Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
   <br> Gyal say I'm bougie (word), way too exclusive (word)
   <br> Chillin' in Dubai know I get it all inclusive (word)
   <br> Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit (yeah)
   <br> To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business
   <br> Lookin' in the mirror sayin', "Mikey, you're the illest" (yeah)
   <br> When I'm James Bond, tryna live my movie like I'm Idris
   <br> So we telling 'em look <br>

   <br>My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
   <br> So much Vossi I might open up a Vossi shop
   <br> Mummy sayin' that I need to get some sleep
   <br> All this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock
   <br> And all this stress has got me wrackin' at my brain (ayy, ayy)
   <br> So tell these likkle fishes back up off my name (ayy, ayy)
   <br> I ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain
   <br> Cah the rules are kinda different when you're baddin' up the game (straight)
   <br> Baddin' up the game, bad it up again (yeah)
   <br> Had 'em up before, have 'em up again (yeah)
   <br> Fake bruddas, man, your mandem will pretend (yeah)
   <br> Pussy by himself, he's battlin' with his friends
   <br> Aww, you man are so insecure, man, it's a joke (man, it's a joke)
   <br> I need a Ballon D'or, 'cause I'm the GOAT (still the GOAT)
   <br> If you believe in your source then raise a toast (raise a toast)
   <br> These are some genius thoughts so make the most
   <br> Told her "Save me some"
   <br> I need all the homage, could you pay me some?
   <br> Man a droppin' bangers on your baby mums
   <br> Gyals say I'm rude (word), they wanna see me nude (word)
   <br> My name stiff chocolate, I got nothing left to prove
   <br> I got holes in my lapel, rubbin' shoulders with your girl
   <br> Which one of, said that I would go to jail? (wah?)
   <br> Well, I guess you have to hold a L
   <br> Tell 'em "This is London city, we the hottest in the world"
   <br> What we tellin' 'em? Look <br>
