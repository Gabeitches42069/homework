   <h1> Clash</h1>
   <h2>Dave ft.Stormzy</h2>
   <p>Chorus: Dave, Headie One]
   <br><em> Jordan 4s or Jordan 1s, Rolexes, got more than one
   <br> My AP cost thirty-one, millimeters: forty-one
    <br> Stick him up with a stick-stick, he drew the shorter one
    <br> You can't short me one, in the club with the shortest one
    <br>  Lighty, the shortest one, on my mind, Jorja one
    <br> Crocodile bag, I bought her one, vegan ting, I slaughter one
    <br> Freaks, I got more than one, fuck, daddy and daughter one (One)
    <br> Tory puttin' in labour, this that Jeremy Corbyn one</em><br>
    
    <br>[Verse 1: Dave]
    <br>Awkward one, race me there, wait, hare, tortoise one
   <br> I need a ting, thirty plus, Blackberry and Walkman 1's
   <br> Look, I left my phone and my babies, silent mode
   <br> My guys on ridin' mode, zombies, survival mode
   <br> He's got a new vest? Man, pop that shield, no microphone
   <br> I'll ride for bro, he's next to I like typin' O
   <br> The score: 5 and 0, 6-to-1
  <br>  For the kicks I love, twelve-fifty-four like 6-to-1
   <br> Babe, can't look at my mentions, that's Area 51
   <br> I'm so close to my pension, my left wrist is sixty-one
   <br>  My left wrist retiring, mm
   <br> My apprentice tryna give Alan Sugar, there's no way I can—<br>
    
   <br> [Chorus: Dave]
   <br><em> Jordan 4s or Jordan 1s, Rolexes, got more than one

   <br> [Verse 2: Stormzy]
   <br>Overrated one, most hated one
   <br> Slid 'round after his birthday, gave him a happy belated one
   <br> Burned that bridge, cremated one, boom-boom, bailiff one
   <br> Got away with murder, this that Viola Davis one
   <br> They stop and stare, watch rare, clear, stainless one
   <br> Debate this one, hatin'-niggas gonna hate this one, ah
   <br> I live life on the high, might fly to Dubai with the guys 'cause the weather's been shit
   <br> I can wear a different kettle every day of the month from a different—</em>
   <br> Rollies, got twenty-one, I been lit since twenty-one
   <br>Girl, I need that gently one, that Savage and Fenty one, hmm
   <br> Dave's got the new Aston Martin plug, could you send me one?
   <br> He said "No need to be rentin' one"
   <br> Big flexes, inventin' one, cold, cold
   <br>My bros don't chat, we just wear all-black on a blend-in one
   <br> Man are talkin' war, don't know 'bout war 'til you end in one
   <br> The machine got sweets, on a vending one
   <br> Needed a hit, could have penned him one, 'cah you're pendin' one
   <br> Aight, she wanna go to the cinema, so we just walk downstairs (Walk downstairs)</em>
   <br> The mortgage cleared, we've overtaken all our peers (All our peers)
   <br> After all these years, disrespect is all I hear
   <br>I'm Pep, I ball with flair
   <br> Off the set, they storm like, off the set, they storm like Piers
   <br> That's what I call mornin' tears
   <br> Them man are talkin' bare, but it's cool 'cause—<br>
     
    
    <br>[Verse 3: Dave]
   <br> I got my ting so I'm more than good, anytime that I walk my hood
   <br> I got the Jordan 4s and 6s, all I need now is Jordyn Woods
   <br> Don't get caught for pus, don't die for nyash
   <br> We slide and crash, sixteen, don't write and clash
   <br> Sixteen, don't battlerap
   <br> She got the WAP and a wap, what are you thinkin'?
   <br> Mans on simpin', I'll buy her a car like a pair of—<br>
